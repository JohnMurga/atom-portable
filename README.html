<h2 id="atom-portable-for-windows">Atom Portable for Windows</h2>
<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>Environment to build an Atom Portable distribution from scratch.</p>
<p>This means taking care of long path issues and other annoyances.<br>For terminal goodness ConEmu is bound to CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+T.</p>
<p>I have bundled my favorite MIT/GPL licensed packages ...<br><em>I would have loved to bundle <a href="https://atom.io/packages/foldingtext-for-atom">FoldingText for Atom</a>, but I can&#39;t as it is it is commercial software.</em></p>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>
<p>You can download and extract the pre-built 7z archive for every release ...<br>That is the easy and very much the faster way <img class="emoji" title=":smirk:" alt="smirk" src="http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/graphics/emojis/smirk.png" height="20"></p>
<p>Or you can download the source ZIP file and build from scratch ...
Which take a long time, but is hopefully as easy as (0!), 1, 2, 3 ...</p>
<p>The build system is an experiment in automating a build with nothing but old fashioned vanilla Windows components (<em>not having to worry about PowerShell versions or the like</em>).</p>
<p>Download the source ZIP file (<em>no Git required</em> <img class="emoji" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" alt="stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye" src="http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/graphics/emojis/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png" height="20">), extract it somewhere ...<br>Then open a CMD window, go to the directory you extracted to and try :</p>
<ul>
<li>To download the packages   <pre><code>0-download-archives.bat
</code></pre></li>
<li>To then create the portable package and install plugins to it  <pre><code>1-extract-and-layout.bat &amp; 2-install-atom-packages.bat
</code></pre></li>
<li>And finally, if you want to create an archive  <pre><code>3-package-binaries.bat
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>The build and package process should work on Windows 7 and above (just like Atom itself)<br><em>Has been tested on Windows7/8/10</em></p>
<h3 id="plans">Plans</h3>
<p>There is still a little tidying up to do ...<br>And I have to document the hidden features <img class="emoji" title=":scream:" alt="scream" src="http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/graphics/emojis/scream.png" height="20">  </p>
<p>As use this myself there is likely to be new features now and then.</p>
<p>But a few things on the todo list :</p>
<ul>
<li>Easier updating</li>
<li>A VS code sister to this project</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway ... 
Enjoy <img class="emoji" title=":thumbsup:" alt="thumbsup" src="http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/graphics/emojis/thumbsup.png" height="20"></p>
